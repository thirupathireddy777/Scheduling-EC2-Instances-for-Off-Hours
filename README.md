# Scheduling-EC2-Instances-for-Off-Hours
Welcome to the quick guide on how to schedule EC2 Instances for Off-Hours. 

🚀 Introduction
Optimizing resources and reducing operational costs remain paramount goals for organizations of all sizes. One particularly effective strategy to achieve this is the automation of EC2 instance start and stop schedules. Imagine a scenario where your Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances automatically power down during off-hours, weekends, or holidays, only to spring back to life exactly when you need them. This level of precision and efficiency isn’t a futuristic dream but a practical reality that can significantly impact your bottom line. In this blog, we delve into the art of time-based EC2 instance scheduling, exploring how it not only curtails unnecessary expenses but also streamlines your cloud operations, ultimately putting you in control of your AWS bills like never before. Say goodbye to the days of manual intervention, and let automation usher in a new era of cost-effective, hassle-free cloud computing.

📜 Step-by-Step Guide
Follow these steps to schedule your EC2-innstances for off hours:

Launching EC2 Instances

Let’s first start by creating 4 instances in our AWS account. We will have an 'env' tag, where 2 of the instances will have a value of 'dev' for the 'env' tag, and the other 2 will have the value 'test' for the 'env' tag. We will be using the tag later in this blog as we run Lambda functions based on tags.

Create 2 EC2 instances, adding a tag key ‘env’ with the value ‘dev’.
Create another pair of instances with tag key ‘env’ and value ‘test’.
Now we have a total of 4 running instances.
Creating a Role

Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions for Lambda to manage EC2 instances.

Creating a Lambda Function

Create a Lambda function using the provided code.
Configure the function with the appropriate IAM role.
Test the function to ensure it can start and stop instances based on tags.
Scheduling the Lambda Function

Set up CloudWatch Events Rules to schedule the Lambda function executions.
Define the schedule based on your requirements, specifying when to start and stop instances.
Using IaC (terraform) to deploy the infrastructure
🎉 Conclusion
Automating the start and stop of EC2 instances through Lambda functions and scheduling is an effective cost-saving strategy. Thank you for joining me on this journey to optimize AWS costs and streamline operations; let's continue learning and innovating together.
